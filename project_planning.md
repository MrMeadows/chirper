Chirper App Planning

Need 'body' container covering central 60% of screen (20% margins either side)
Need 'submission' container for text and input on bottom 25% of screen
Need text input and submit button on bottom of page
Need 'timeline' container within body container

Need to design in CSS *only to distinguish different parts of project*

- Submit function takes input and pushes a card onto the screen containing the inputted text
	- find correct term from previous lab
	- find a way to add a timestamp to the bottom corner

- Text field
	- fixed size
	- text-wrap overflow functionality
	- add scroll functionality to text-field
	- automatic scroll down when beyond text-box capacity
	- character counter somewhere... somewhere
