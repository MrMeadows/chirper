Discussing with Higgs, I have determined a structure for my application. As it stands, I will need to create three different React components to make my project function the way I intend. **'App.jsx'** will exist as the foundational structure for my project, with **'Feed.jsx'** acting as the timeline of posts and **'Input.jsx'** acting as the user input and submission section of the project - with an absolute position at the bottom of the page. This location may change in the future.
