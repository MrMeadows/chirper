I've written and added the most basic versions of the Feed and Input components into the App.jsx file. My next goals are to style the Input component and create the cards that will reside within the Feed component. After that, I will work on a continuous scroll functionality within the Feed component. I have a baby coming in approximately thirty days. We'll see how much progress I can make.

Discussing with Higgs, I have determined a structure for my application. As it stands, I will need to create three different React components to make my project function the way I intend. **'App.jsx'** will exist as the foundational structure for my project, with **'Feed.jsx'** acting as the timeline of posts and **'Input.jsx'** acting as the user input and submission section of the project - with an absolute position at the bottom of the page. This location may change in the future.
